EMAIL_INPUT
===========
This is a sample application I wrote to demonstrate how using the HTML5 email input type is easier on mobile browser users than using a simple input text field. 

You'll find an article that describes this application on my web site at [johnwargo.com](http://www.johnwargo.com/mobile-development/email-input-on-the-web.html)
